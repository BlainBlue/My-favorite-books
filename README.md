# My-favorite-books
This is my favorite book that i have read in this quaratine year(2021).
Rebecca is the book name written by Daphne du Maurier. Although i have read a lot of books in this year, for me Rebecca is still the best. Similar with Jane Eyre, the genre of this book is thriller, crime, romance. Started with the line " Last night, i dreamt i went back to Manderley again", Rebecca became the stand-out book in its genre
